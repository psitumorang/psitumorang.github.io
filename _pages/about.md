# About

<p align="justify"> I am a data scientist at the Volpe Center, where I leverage information contained in databases of the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide data products for the department's agencies. Currently, I lead data projects aimed at improving road safety by measuring the effectiveness of safety systems and evaluating accident risk factors. As a data consultant, I love the process of understanding stakeholders' problems and delivering cost-effective data solutions that provide positive, impactful results.

Outside of the Department of Transportation, I am a soldier in the U.S. Army Reserves with over a decade of experience as a logistician. I currently serve as head of distribution section of the 77th Sustainment Brigade's support operations. Previously, I served as commanding officer of Charlie Company of the 3-518th Infantry Regiment, where I have the privilege of leading the Army's best drill sergeants in training the Army's future leaders.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science (Magna Cum Laude) from Temple University's Fox School Honors Program and a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Pennsylvania.
